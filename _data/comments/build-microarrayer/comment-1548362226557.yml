  Robert, thanks for publishing this information. I purchased two sets of this
  same DeRisi microarrayer hardware (without the tables) at auction from the
  University of Texas, with the intention of recycling it to construct a CNC
  machine tool. It was very interesting to find this background on the DeRisi
  microarrayer system, and the M-Guide is a big help in rebuilding the
  assemblies and cabling.
