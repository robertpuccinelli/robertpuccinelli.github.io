## Introduction

Briefly, I found the following resources to be useful for embedded hardware development. More resources will be added over time.

### Microcontrollers

**[The Amazing $1 Microcontroller](https://jaycarlson.net/microcontrollers/)** A very informative and thorough review.

### Debugging

**[Debugging Firmware with GDB](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdb-for-firmware-1)** A nice, short walkthrough for remote debugging.

**[GDB Cheatsheet](https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)** Tidy collection of GDB commands.

**[GDB Tutorial for C](https://www.techbeamers.com/how-to-use-gdb-top-debugging-tips/)** Compiler optimizations for debugging and more.

### Firmware
