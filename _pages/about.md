## _Intro_
_"Every individual walks a journey of a thousand miles. Arduous, uncertain, at times seemingly unsurmountable, the journey continues against the odds. However, when we examine our own particular path, we find something quite peculiar as it seems to be a mix of treading paths of those before us, crossing paths with those amongst us, and forging ahead on our own into the unknown. Let us not forget that our journey would not be possible if it were not for our past, present and future comrades."_

## _About Me_

Born in southern California in 1992, Robert would be confined by state boundaries for the next 25 years of his life. Although deprived of experiencing foreign lands, he would often explore rugged wilderness of California, investigate foreign cultures through non-native Californians, and integrate with the scientific community.
