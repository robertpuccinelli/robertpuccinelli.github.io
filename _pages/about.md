  - excerpt: ">_Every individual walks a journey of a thousand miles. Arduous, uncertain, at times seemingly insurmountable, the journey continues against the odds. However, when we examine our own particular path, we find something quite peculiar as it seems to be a combination of treading the paths of those before us, crossing paths with those amongst us, and forging ahead on our own into the unknown. Let us not forget that our journey would not be possible if it were not for our past, present and future comrades._"

## _About Robert_

Born in California in 1992, Robert would be confined by state boundaries for the next 24 years of his life. Although deprived of experiencing foreign lands, he would often explore the rugged wilderness of California, investigate foreign cultures vicariously through non-native Californians, and find his own niche within the scientific community over the years. He graduated from the University of California, Merced in 2014 with B.S. degrees in biology and physics before transitioning to biophysical microfluidic assays and instrumentation engineering at Stanford.

### [_Research_](http://robertpuccinelli.com/research/)

My career in research began somewhat unexpectedly during my undergraduate years at University of California, Merced (2010-2014) as I was exploring emerging and unfamiliar interests. It was through these early experiences and encouragement from various mentors that I found nascent attraction to the engineering discipline, which was further refined during my time at Stanford. Brief summaries of my research are listed below:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

* [_Fordyce Lab_](https://www.fordycelab.com){:target="_blank"} _('14 - present)_ : Founding member of the lab. Built optical, pneumatic, microarrayer systems and developed [semi-automated analysis software](https://github.com/FordyceLab/MITOMIAnalysis_Software){:target="_blank"}. Studied transcription factor - DNA binding kinetics using high-throughput microfluidics.
* [_Gopinathan Lab_](http://gopinathanlab.ucmerced.edu/){:target="_blank"} _('13 - '14)_ : Modeled actin dynamics to predict f-actin polymerization at the plasma membrane interface with potential applications for predicting cell shape on nanoscale topography. Senior thesis project for physics degree.

* [_McCloskey Lab_](http://kara-mccloskey.squarespace.com/){:target="_blank"} _('11 - '13)_ : Worked with postdoctoral fellow [William Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/turnerws/){:target="_blank"} to differentiate mouse and human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes with the conventional methods as well as nanoscale topography and electrical pacing.
