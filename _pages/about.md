  - excerpt: ">_Every individual walks a journey of a thousand miles. Arduous, uncertain, at times seemingly insurmountable, the journey continues against the odds. However, when we examine our own particular path, we find something quite peculiar as it seems to be a combination of treading the paths of those before us, crossing paths with those amongst us, and forging ahead on our own into the unknown. Let us not forget that our journey would not be possible if it were not for our past, present and future comrades._"

## _About Robert_

Born in California in 1992, Robert would be confined by state boundaries for the next 24 years of his life. Although deprived of experiencing foreign lands, he would often explore the rugged wilderness of California, investigate foreign cultures vicariously through non-native Californians, and find his own niche within the scientific community over the years. He graduated from the University of California, Merced in 2014 with B.S. degrees in biology and physics before transitioning to biophysical microfluidic assays at Stanford followed by hardware engineering at Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub.

### [_Research_](http://robertpuccinelli.com/research/)

My career in research began somewhat unexpectedly during my undergraduate years at University of California, Merced (2010-2014) as I was exploring emerging and unfamiliar interests. It was through these early experiences and encouragement from various mentors that I found nascent attraction to the engineering discipline, which was further refined during my time at Stanford. Brief summaries of my research are listed below:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

* [_Fordyce Lab_](https://www.fordycelab.com){:target="_blank"} _('14 - '17)_ : Founding member of the lab. Built optical, pneumatic, microarrayer systems and developed [semi-automated analysis software](https://github.com/FordyceLab/MITOMIAnalysis_Software){:target="_blank"}. Studied transcription factor - DNA binding kinetics using high-throughput microfluidics.
* [_Gopinathan Lab_](http://gopinathanlab.ucmerced.edu/){:target="_blank"} _('13 - '14)_ : Modeled actin dynamics to predict f-actin polymerization at the plasma membrane interface with potential applications for predicting cell shape on nanoscale topography. Senior thesis project for physics degree.

* [_McCloskey Lab_](http://kara-mccloskey.squarespace.com/){:target="_blank"} _('11 - '13)_ : Worked with postdoctoral fellow [William Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/turnerws/){:target="_blank"} to differentiate mouse and human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes with the conventional methods as well as nanoscale topography and electrical pacing.

### _Personal Projects_

My college town had one bike shop that was exorbitantly priced and often sold me the wrong parts at a time that I had little financial stability. Frustrated that I had to saw off kevlar tire beads that were too small for my wheels one evening, I decided to learn the mechanics of bicycles and be self-sufficient. Through that experience and my mentor, [Carrie Menke](http://faculty1.ucmerced.edu/cmenke){:target="_blank"}, _strongly suggesting_ that I study physics, I entered the realm of physics and engineering. My interest would grow with each step of the way as I would later build scientific instrumentation for the Fordyce Lab such as a microarrayer, move on to tinker with larger mechanics such as Jeep 4.0L Inline 6 engine, and draft designs for my own instrumentation including a rapid response antibiotic resistance screen. I intend to make all of my own personal instrumentation open source once I have a working prototype.

### [_Exploring the Outdoors_](http://robertpuccinelli.com/outdoors/)

My childhood was riddled with outdoor adventures, which I credit to my parents, and has become ingrained in who I am. It started with family trips, continued into Cub Scouts, and then into Boy Scouts of America (attained the highest rank of Eagle Scout at age 14), and now I venture out on my own. Up until June 2017, my adventures had been within the limits of California, but I hope to spend more time away from California and share these experiences on this site. All of the images posted on this website were either taken by me or others who have joined me on a given adventure.
